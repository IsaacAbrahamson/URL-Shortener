I started this project as a RESTful API microservice, but then added some more functionality to have a complete fullstack web app. I built the backend microservice with Node, Express and Mongo, and then I built a simple frontend to call the API. While you probably won't use this for any real purpose, I learned a lot about how the backend works with this simple app.
